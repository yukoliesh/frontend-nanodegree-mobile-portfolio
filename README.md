* Mobile PSI score: 93
* Desktop PSI score: 95

## What I Have done

### The original Page Score on pizza.html was
* Mobile - 36
* Desktop - 36

### The list of Optimization
* Reduced the images' size to minimum
* Replaced the CSS in inline
* Minified the bootstrap file
* Changing the .querySelector() to .getElementById()
* Changing the .querySelectorAll() to .getElementsByClassName()
* The background of Pizza is reduced
* Added pizzas when the page loads
* The number of pizzas are reduced based on the browser window resolution
* Increased the site performance by adding the transform: translateZ(0); and
backface-visibility: hidden


### The Result after the change
* Time to generate pizzas on load: 11.915000000000077ms
* Average scripting time to generate last 10 frames: 2.13049999999987ms
* Average scripting time to generate last 10 frames: 0.10250000000032741ms
* Average scripting time to generate last 10 frames: 0.09399999999977808ms
* Time to resize pizzas: 1.5999999999985448ms (Large)
* Time to resize pizzas: 1.6350000000020373ms (Medium)
* Time to resize pizzas: 0.9750000000058208ms (Small)
* Average scripting time to generate last 10 frames: 0.11499999999932697ms

## How I ran this test
* I ran the local server and created a public URL by ngrok
* I ran the PageSpeed Tools test page
* Check through the Console and Performance in Chrome DevTool.


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!



#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
